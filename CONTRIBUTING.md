# Contributing to Pylon

Thank you for considering contributing to our project! Your contributions are highly appreciated.

## How to Contribute

1. **Just Contribute:** We welcome all contributions. Whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, or an improvement to existing code, your efforts help make this project better.
   
2. **Follow Semantic Commit Conventions:** To maintain a clean and understandable commit history, please follow the conventions for semantic commits. This means structuring your commit messages as follows:

   ```
   type(scope): subject
   ```

   Where:
   - `type` indicates the type of change. Common types include:
     - `feat`: A new feature
     - `fix`: A bug fix
     - `docs`: Documentation only changes
     - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
     - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
     - `test`: Adding missing or correcting existing tests
     - `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
   - `scope` provides additional context about the change (optional)
   - `subject` is a brief description of the change

   Examples:
   - `feat(auth): add login functionality`
   - `fix(profile): correct user profile picture URL`

We appreciate your time and effort in contributing to Pylon!
